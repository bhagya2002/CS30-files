Start Code for Spell Check Asgn (JavaScript)

This project was build to learn linear and binary search.

Linear Algorithm:
- goes from left to right through the whole array to check for an item 
- this is slow compared to binary

Binary Algorithm:
- starts from a midpoint and check if item is the midpoint
- if not then it checks if it is larger or smaller than the midpoint to eleminate a large range of possible values
- continues to narrow down using midpoint method
- faster compared to linear
